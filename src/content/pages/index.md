## I’ve been where you are.

To help you determine how ready your agency is for the next level of achievement, I created an agency acquisition readiness checklist.

You’re here because growing a digital agency to be acquired is hard. You might feel like you have big pieces in place, things are headed in the right direction, but you don’t know what’s missing. Or, you’ve plateaued, and need to know how to get to the next level.

I’ve been where you are. I grew a fully remote digital agency over 8 years from 2007 to 2015. After it was [acquired](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150313005581/en/AdMedia-Partners-Advises-Mediacurrent-in-its-Acquisition-by-Code-and-Theory), I stayed on to expand the team to 90 full time members and achieve the full acquisition earn-out. Throughout the agency’s growth process, there were numerous unexpected twists and turns. I learned what seemed like a life time of lessons that will help you prepare for virtually any obstacle to making your business thrive. In fact, even if you aren’t interested in selling your business now, I can show you how to set a foundation for years of sustained growth.

Digital agencies are acquired every year. But, not every acquisition is the same. Some are distressed sales, some have terms that are unfair, and there are acquisitions that go sideways after deal closing, resulting in a lost earn-out opportunity. Every founder I've talked to wants to be as prepared as possible for positioning their agency for optimal success. I’ll never forget our closing attorney saying that the majority of acquisitions involving an earn-out end early with a poor outcome. I can show you how to get your agency’s maximum value at closing and how to achieve your full earn-out. I’m based in the Atlanta area but work with agencies around the world.
